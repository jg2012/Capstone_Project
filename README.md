## Setup Instructions

### Virtual Environment Setup

To ensure that your project dependencies are managed properly and to avoid conflicts with other projects, it is recommended to use a virtual environment. Below are the steps to create, activate, and install the required dependencies.

#### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jg2012/Capstone_Project
cd Capstone_Project


#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment in the project directory. You can use venv for this purpose.

For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

For macOS and Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

#### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
To activate the virtual environment, run the following command:
For Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

For macOS and Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 4. Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Deactivate the Virtual Environment
When you are done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by simply running:
```bash
deactivate
```

#### Additional Information 
To add new packages to the project, use pip install package-name and then update the requirements.txt file with the new dependencies:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Conclsion  

In this report, we successfully utilized historical data from 2020 to 2023 to predict Carlos Alcaraz's match outcomes for 2024. The ensemble model, combining logistic regression and random forest classifiers, demonstrated robust performance with an accuracy of 95.56 percent. The visualizations provided clear insights into the predicted win probabilities for upcoming matches. These findings offer valuable information for coaches, analysts, and fans, enhancing strategic decision-making for future matches.

## Future Work 

Future research should integrate additional performance metrics, such as player fatigue, weather conditions, and real-time match statistics, to improve the model's accuracy and robustness. Exploring more advanced models, like deep learning and reinforcement learning, could provide deeper insights and better predictions. Additionally, implementing real-time data feeds and continuous model updating will ensure the model remains relevant and accurate over time. Finally, expanding the analysis to include more players and matches will generalize the model's applicability across the sport.

## Result Interpretations 

The ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 95.56 percent, indicating a high level of performance. The model shows high precision and recall for predicting wins, with detailed classification reports provided for further insight. The confusion matrix suggests that the model is effective at predicting match outcomes, which is valuable for strategic decision-making.
